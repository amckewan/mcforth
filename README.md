# McForth

This is a byte-code Forth in C inspired by cmForth and ThisForth. It was
developed and tested on Linux but should be reasonably portable to other
operating systems. It can be built with either a 32- or 64-bit cell size.

It has all of the 2012 standard core words and passes
the core test suite, but is not fully documented as a standard system.

See `docs` for more information or run `mkdocs serve` to view in a browser.
