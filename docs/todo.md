### To-do list

* decompiler
* optimizing compiler
* make meta compiler all interpreting (no IMMEDIATE)
* check for redefined words
* add value
* add defer

### Do later

* use 64-bit compiler
* allow 32 or 64-bit to work
* view source


### Could-do list

...but not really necessary for my purposes (see goals)

* immediate in a standard way (so find returns 1)
* fm/mod (steal from Wil)
