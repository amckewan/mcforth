### To-do list

* optimizing compiler
* lit+op
* cond+branch
* inline const/var
* multi-op inline (e.g. 2dup )
* lit+cond+branch
* specials (e.g. dup if )
* lit+pick

* move what I can from meta to rth

### Do later

* improve documentation (wip)
* use 64-bit compiler
* allow 32 or 64-bit to work
* view source


### Could-do list

...but not really necessary for my purposes (see goals)

* immediate in a standard way
* fm/mod (steal from Wil)
