# To-do list

* path in forth
* move stuff from kernel to extend
* remove non-essential code words (keep opcodes trim)
* make branch offsets 16 bits if it keeps being a problem

## Maybe do

* add standard locals

## Optimizing compiler

* inline lits with prims (partially tried)
* specials (e.g. dup if )
* lit pick
* lit lit within

## Objects

* Write primatives
* Add indexed instance variables

## Do later (or never)

* add require
* view source
* get .s to fully observe base (dot())
